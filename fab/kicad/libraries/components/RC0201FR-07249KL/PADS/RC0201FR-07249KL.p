"Description" The resistor is constructed on top of a high-grade ceramic body. Internal metal electrodes are added on each end to make the contacts to the thick film resistive element. The composition of the resistive element is a noble metal imbedded into a glass and covered by a second glass to prevent environmental influences. The resistor is laser trimmed to the rated resistance value. The resistor is covered with a protective epoxy coat, finally the two external terminations
